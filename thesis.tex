\chapter*{Abstract}
This study focuses on the design and
implementation of a QR code-based encryption and decryption
system for triangular geometry problems. The encryption
stage starts with the development of a context-free grammar
to describe triangular problems in a formal language.
Triangle descriptions are then encrypted using a traditional
cryptography algorithm and lastly the corresponding QR
code is generated. In the decryption stage, the QR code is
decrypted and a parser, which is automatically produced by
the JavaCC tool, is used to analyze and show the related
problem graphically. The developed system provides QR code
reader-like tool and presents an elegant way to be able to
display mathematical problems on various devices easily. With
such a tool, the whole questions of an exam can be encoded in
QR code and stored in smaller sizes. This would significantly
increase the security of exams and decrease question data,
which can be particularly transmitted on mobile devices, in size

\chapter*{Acknowlogment}
Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my
advisor HÃ¼seyin Pehlivan for the continuous support of my
MSc study and related research, for his patience, motivation,and immense knowledge. His guidance helped me in all the time of research and writing of this paper. I could not have imagined having a better advisor and mentor for my MSc
study.
